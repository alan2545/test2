# Timeline of the Internet
By Alan and Cris
End of world War 1
-	Aruthor Scherbius(German engineer) invented the Enigma and the German Government later adapted it in the World War 2.

1945
-	The American finished creating the ENIAC 
-	It weighed over 30 tons, had over 18,000 vacuum tubes with 70,000 resistors and 10,000 capacitors
-	It costed about $487,000 to make and with inflation that is around  $7,051,000
-	Its operation stopped in 1956

1957
-	Russia launched sputnik and it made America feel as if they were behind in space technology

February 7th, 1958
-	Advanced research project agency(ARPA) was created to keep up with the soviets.
-	ARPA was in charge of the space program and also dealt with computer science.
-	The space program got its own agency(NASA).
-	Computer research was left for while.
-	After the landing on the moon computer research was picked up and it started to make its mark.
1961-1962
Leonard Kleinrock applied queueing theory to data transmission. in his words, “a que Is a very simple structure. It’s simply a system to which you arrive, hang around a while and leave”

Early 1960’s
-	American government hired Paul Baran to build an indestructible communication network. After a lot of research they came up with packets and packet switching.
1969
ARPANET

1965
-	Larry Roberts built the world’s first experimental connection between two computers at MIT

1966
-	Bob Taylor of ARPA didn’t like moving from terminal to terminal so he had an idea to create a network to connect all the computers to work from just one terminal. He was given a million dollars to turn the theory of a computer network into a reality. He recruited Larry and formed a team

1966-67
-	Larry Roberts had the network designed figured out. He now needed engineers to build it. The network would use Interface Message Processors (IMP) and packet switching

1968
-	A company called BBN seemed the most interested in the project

January 1st, 1969
-	BBM won the contract and they got to work

October 1st, 1969
-	After a short deadline and a lot of work. The first ever packet was sent and received. It was sent From and IMP at BBN to an IMP in UCLA and there the ARPANET was born

End of 1969
-	There were 4 total sites connected in the network

April 1971
-	The ARPANET had 18 mainframe computers hooked up into the network.

1972
-	Raymond Tomlinson created the first Email program. Making the computer network more useful. Nobody asked for the program, but Tomlinson just did it and he provided something people never knew they needed. 
-	There were less than 25 sites online

1973
-	The development of TCP/IP begins by Vinton Cerf and Bob Kahn
-	University of London and Royal Radar establishment connect to the ARPANET. Making it the first international connection

1974
-	Vinton Cerf and Bob Kahn publish “A Protocol for Packet Network Interconnectivity” This was also the first time the word “Internet” was used.

1977 
-	The CSNET was created by Lawrence Lanceweber. It was created mostly for university’s in the US and computer research groups

1979
-	USENET was created for news and discussion groups

###1990

- The start of billion dollar companies apple and google
- Xerox companany - created photocopier machines 
    - Made gui interface 
     - did not know how amaIng this was
- Apple and microsoft saw it and stole it
  -Bill Gates and Steve jobs went to this company as kids and were able to see and utilitze this interface for their own countries.

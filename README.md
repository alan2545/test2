# Timeline of the Internet
By Alan and Cris

## End of world War 1
-	Aruthor Scherbius(German engineer) invented the Enigma and the German Government later adapted it in the World War 2.

## 1945
-	The American finished creating the ENIAC 
-	It weighed over 30 tons, had over 18,000 vacuum tubes with 70,000 resistors and 10,000 capacitors
-	It costed about $487,000 to make and with inflation that is around  $7,051,000
-	Its operation stopped in 1956

## 1957
-	Russia launched sputnik and it made America feel as if they were behind in space technology

## February 7th, 1958
-	Advanced research project agency(ARPA) was created to keep up with the soviets.
-	ARPA was in charge of the space program and also dealt with computer science.
-	The space program got its own agency(NASA).
-	Computer research was left for while.
-	After the landing on the moon computer research was picked up and it started to make its mark.

## 1961-1962
Leonard Kleinrock applied queueing theory to data transmission. in his words, “a que Is a very simple structure. It’s simply a system to which you arrive, hang around a while and leave”

## Early 1960’s
-	American government hired Paul Baran to build an indestructible communication network. After a lot of research they came up with packets and packet switching.

## 1965
-	Larry Roberts built the world’s first experimental connection between two computers at MIT

## 1966
-	Bob Taylor of ARPA didn’t like moving from terminal to terminal so he had an idea to create a network to connect all the computers to work from just one terminal. He was given a million dollars to turn the theory of a computer network into a reality. He recruited Larry and formed a team

### 1966-67
-	Larry Roberts had the network designed figured out. He now needed engineers to build it. The network would use Interface Message Processors (IMP) and packet switching

## 1968
-	A company called BBN seemed the most interested in the project

## January 1st, 1969
-	BBM won the contract and they got to work

## October 1st, 1969
-	After a short deadline and a lot of work. The first ever packet was sent and received. It was sent From and IMP at BBN to an IMP in UCLA and there the ARPANET was born

## End of 1969
-	There were 4 total sites connected in the network

## April 1971
-	The ARPANET had 18 mainframe computers hooked up into the network.

## 1972
-	Raymond Tomlinson created the first Email program. Making the computer network more useful. Nobody asked for the program, but Tomlinson just did it and he provided something people never knew they needed. 
-	There were less than 25 sites online

## 1973
-	The development of TCP/IP begins by Vinton Cerf and Bob Kahn
-	University of London and Royal Radar establishment connect to the ARPANET. Making it the first international connection

## 1974
-	Vinton Cerf and Bob Kahn publish “A Protocol for Packet Network Interconnectivity” This was also the first time the word “Internet” was used.

## 1977 
-	The CSNET was created by Lawrence Lanceweber. It was created mostly for university’s in the US and computer research groups

## 1979
-	USENET was created for news and discussion groups

## 1980
-	The Internet Activities Board (IAB) was created by Dr. Barry Leiner.
-	Mr. Landweber created the first network gateways between European Countries and the US

## 1982
-	The first initial wide area network (WAN) was created by Teus Hagen in Europe

## 1983
-	ARPANET changed to TCP/IP making it the universal protocol for the Internet
-	The Domain Naming system is created by Paul Mockapetris. Instead of typing in IP numbers. Users only have to type in website names

## August 3rd, 1984
-	Germany receives its first ever email.

## 1985
-	Symbolics.com becomes the first registered domain
-	NSFNET was developed by Dr. Stephen Wolff. It was the first open computer network in the US and  It was just “a network of networks that connected academic users along with the ARPANET”


## 1990
- The start of billion dollar companies apple and google
- Xerox company - created photocopier machines 
    - Made gui interface 
     - did not know how amazing this was
- Apple and microsoft saw it and stole it
  -Bill Gates and Steve jobs went to this company as kids and were able to see and utilitze this interface for their own companies.  

## 1995
- Email Surpasses Postal Mail
  - There is more email than postal mail in the U.S. 
-  MP3 Is Developed
   - Karlheinz Brandenburg and his team settle on a file extension for the audio format, shortening MPEG1, Layer 3 to MP3.

## 2000
- Dot com bubble
  - period of excessive speculation mainly in the United States that occurred roughly from 1995 to 2000, a period of extreme growth in the usage and adoption of the Internet.
- Algore pushed to make internet public 
- ICAN internation coroprations assign number and names -  
    - ip address and domain 
    - networking backbone
  Dns domain name server 
- Wc3 - what runs in the network
  - this is where http originates from 
 
## 2010
 - Social media rises with the advent of sites such as myspace, facebook, twitter
 - Social media are interactive internet-based applications. User-generated content is the lifeblood of social media.
 -  China Dominates Internet Usage
   - By 2010, there are over 450 million Chinese Internet users.
   - Surprising because internet is heavily censored 

## The Future
 - AI
   - Artificial intelligence becomes more invested in
 - Automation
   - Jobs that are easy are becoming automated leading to fears as well as hopes
 - Expanded storage space 
   - One terabyte can fit in a microSD card

# Instructional
## This is an instructional piece on how to use Git, GitHub, Repository, Clone, Commit, Push, Pull, Branch, Merge, Merge Conflict, Fetch, Remote
- Git - git is an open source version control system that allows users to track changes during the development of a project
- GitHub - this is what connects webStorm with with Git. it is a web based hosting service for version control using Git. This is where you put your repositories, communicate with other devs in the community and copy other people repository 
- Webstorm - this is an IDE for Javascript. "The smartest JavaScript IDE"
- first off your gonna start off by making Git Hub and WebStorm account
![alt text](dist/img/webstorm_user.png)
- here you fill out all your info and after you do that you start your download process
- while WebStorm is downloading move on to github and create an account
![alt text](dist/img/github_newuser.png)
- after you are done creating that check on your WebStorm download. it should be done by now.
- after your download you are going to have to do some configuration. After all of that you can start on your new project
![alt text](dist/img/opening_webstorm.png)
- when you first open up WebStorm this the what is gonna shown to you. Just click on create new project.
![alt text](dist/img/after_clicking_create.png)
- this is the prompt you are going to receive after clicking create new project. for the sake of this tutorial we are just going with empty project. click create after.
![alt text](dist/img/userinterface.png)
- this is the interface. Get use to it because you are going to see it for a while
![alt text](dist/img/puttinggit.png)
- before we do any coding, click on VCS and then click enable version control integration. this will give us Git
![alt text](dist/img/choosinggit.png)
- once you click that this menu is gonna appear. Click the drop down menu and click git and then click ok
- Now lets do a small recap. We have a GitHub account, we have a WebStorm account and WebStorm downloaded and integrated Git into our WebStorm.
- After all of that we are going back into GitHub to create our first repository.
- go back to GitHub
![alt text](dist/img/goingbacktohub.png)
- once you are in GitHub go into your account. after that click on your profile icon on the top right. 
- Once you click that a drop down menu is going to appear. 
- Click on Your repositories
![alt text](dist/img/repos.png)
- after that, click on the big green button on the top right corner that says New.
![alt text](dist/img/insiderepo.png)
- this is what you are going to see when you want to create a new Repo.
- It is very straight forward. For this demonstration we are going to leave everything as is but you should include a README file.
- after you are done configuring click the create repository button.
![alt text](dist/img/coppylink.png)
- once you click create repository, you will be moved to this page.
- copy the link that is next to SSH button. That is our link for our Git
![alt text](dist/img/goingbacktoweb.png)
- go back to WebStorm and go under VCS again. once the drop down menu appears hover your mouse over Checkout from Version Control
![alt text](dist/img/clickgit.png)
- once you do that click on Git
![alt text](dist/img/pastinglink.png)
-after clicking Git, you past the link in the URL option and click clone.
![alt text](dist/img/mightnot.png)
- you might or might not get this message. Just click Add
![alt text](dist/img/newfile.png)
-Just to test out if the GitHub worked. we are going to create a new file and add some text
-right click over the folder, hover over new and then click file.
![alt text](dist/img/nameit.png)
- you can name it what ever you want.
![alt text](dist/img/justclickadd.png)
- Again. if this pops up just click add. 
- you can click the box next to Remember, don't ask again if you dont want to see the message again.
![alt text](dist/img/commit.png)
- once you are done writing your text you always want to commit your work. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP IN THIS PROCESS.
- without committing all your work is gone.
- click on VCS and then click on Commit...
![alt text](dist/img/addames.png)
- Then you add a message that describes what you did. 
- Be descriptive when you are working on a real project or working with others so there is no confusion
![alt text](dist/img/pull.png)
-click on VCS again
- hover your mouse over Git
- click push
- pushing your work is very important. It is like taking your work and giving it to your partner for them to see your work.
![alt text](dist/img/afterpush.png)
- after clicking push this menu is going to appear
- just click the button on the bottom right that says Push.
![alt text](dist/img/checkgit.png)
- go back to git to see if worked.
- you might have to refresh the page.
- Boom. There it is. all your handwork is now on GitHub all thanks to Git.

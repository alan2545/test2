# Timeline of the Internet
By Alan and Cris

End of world War 1
-	Aruthor Scherbius(German engineer) invented the Enigma and the German Government later adapted it in the World War 2.

1945
-	The American finished creating the ENIAC 
-	It weighed over 30 tons, had over 18,000 vacuum tubes with 70,000 resistors and 10,000 capacitors
-	It costed about $487,000 to make and with inflation that is around  $7,051,000
-	Its operation stopped in 1956

1957
-	Russia launched sputnik and it made America feel as if they were behind in space technology

February 7th, 1958
-	Advanced research project agency(ARPA) was created to keep up with the soviets.
-	ARPA was in charge of the space program and also dealt with computer science.
-	The space program got its own agency(NASA).
-	Computer research was left for while.
-	After the landing on the moon computer research was picked up and it started to make its mark.
1961-1962
Leonard Kleinrock applied queueing theory to data transmission. in his words, “a que Is a very simple structure. It’s simply a system to which you arrive, hang around a while and leave”

Early 1960’s
-	American government hired Paul Baran to build an indestructible communication network. After a lot of research they came up with packets and packet switching.
1969
ARPANET

1965
-	Larry Roberts built the world’s first experimental connection between two computers at MIT

1966
-	Bob Taylor of ARPA didn’t like moving from terminal to terminal so he had an idea to create a network to connect all the computers to work from just one terminal. He was given a million dollars to turn the theory of a computer network into a reality. He recruited Larry and formed a team

1966-67
-	Larry Roberts had the network designed figured out. He now needed engineers to build it. The network would use Interface Message Processors (IMP) and packet switching

1968
-	A company called BBN seemed the most interested in the project

January 1st, 1969
-	BBM won the contract and they got to work

October 1st, 1969
-	After a short deadline and a lot of work. The first ever packet was sent and received. It was sent From and IMP at BBN to an IMP in UCLA and there the ARPANET was born

End of 1969
-	There were 4 total sites connected in the network

April 1971
-	The ARPANET had 18 mainframe computers hooked up into the network.

1972
-	Raymond Tomlinson created the first Email program. Making the computer network more useful. Nobody asked for the program, but Tomlinson just did it and he provided something people never knew they needed. 
-	There were less than 25 sites online

1973
-	The development of TCP/IP begins by Vinton Cerf and Bob Kahn
-	University of London and Royal Radar establishment connect to the ARPANET. Making it the first international connection

1974
-	Vinton Cerf and Bob Kahn publish “A Protocol for Packet Network Interconnectivity” This was also the first time the word “Internet” was used.

1977 
-	The CSNET was created by Lawrence Lanceweber. It was created mostly for university’s in the US and computer research groups

1979
-	USENET was created for news and discussion groups

1980
-	The Internet Activities Board (IAB) was created by Dr. Barry Leiner.
-	Mr. Landweber created the first network gateways between European Countries and the US

1982
-	The first initial wide area network (WAN) was created by Teus Hagen in Europe

1983
-	ARPANET changed to TCP/IP making it the universal protocol for the Internet
-	The Domain Naming system is created by Paul Mockapetris. Instead of typing in IP numbers. Users only have to type in website names

August 3rd, 1984
-	Germany receives its first ever email.

1985
-	Symbolics.com becomes the first registered domain
-	NSFNET was developed by Dr. Stephen Wolff. It was the first open computer network in the US and  It was just “a network of networks that connected academic users along with the ARPANET”

###1990

- The start of billion dollar companies apple and google
- Xerox companany - created photocopier machines 
    - Made gui interface 
     - did not know how amazing this was
- Apple and microsoft saw it and stole it
  -Bill Gates and Steve jobs went to this company as kids and were able to see and utilitze this interface for their own companies.  

###1995

- Email Surpasses Postal Mail
  - There is more email than postal mail in the U.S. 
-  MP3 Is Developed
   - Karlheinz Brandenburg and his team settle on a file extension for the audio format, shortening MPEG1, Layer 3 to MP3.

###2000
- Dot com bubble
  - period of excessive speculation mainly in the United States that occurred roughly from 1995 to 2000, a period of extreme growth in the usage and adoption of the Internet.
- Algore pushed to make internet public 
- ICAN internation coroprations assign number and names -  
    - ip address and domain 
    - networking backbone
  Dns domain name server 
- Wc3 - what runs in the network
  - this is where http originates from 
   

###2010
- Social media rises with the advent of sites such as myspace, facebook, twitter
- Social media are interactive internet-based applications. User-generated content is the lifeblood of social media.
-  China Dominates Internet Usage
  - By 2010, there are over 450 million Chinese Internet users.
  - Surprising because internet is heavily censored 
###The Future
- AI
  - Artificial intelligence becomes more invested in
- Automation
  - Jobs that are easy are becoming automated leading to fears as well as hopes
- Expanded storage space 
  - One terabyte can fit in a microSD card
